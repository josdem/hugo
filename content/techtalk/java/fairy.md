[Fairy](https://devskiller.github.io/jfairy/) is a Java fake data generator project and this time I will show you how to use this library to generate random testing information data. First let's create an empty basic Java project using [lazybones](https://github.com/pledbrook/lazybones). In order to install lazybones in your computer, please use this tool: [sdkman](https://sdkman.io/).

```bash
lazybones create java-basic jfairy-workshop
```
