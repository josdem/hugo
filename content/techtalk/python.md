**Why do people use Python?**

* Software quality (readable, reusable and maintainable)
* Developer productivity (is typically one-third to one-fifth the size of equivalent C++ or Java code)
* Program portability (Most Python programs run unchanged on all major computer platforms)
* Support libraries (Python comes with a large collection of prebuilt and portable functionality)
* Component integration (Python scripts can easily communicate with other parts of an application)
* Enjoyment (Easy to built-in toolset)

**Is Python a "Scripting Language"**

Python is a general-purspose programming language that is often applied in scripting roles. It is commonly defined as an object-oriented scripting language- a definition that blends support for OOP with and overall orientation toward scripting roles.

**What are Python's technical strengths?**

* It's Object-Oriented and Functional
* It's free (To use and distribute)
* It's open source
* It's portable
* It's powerful
* It has a large collection of precoded library tools
* It's mixable (Ex. Python's C API lets C programs call and be called by Python)
