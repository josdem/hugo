[Travis](https://travis-ci.com/) is a hosted, distributed continuous integration service used to build and test software projects hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/). Travis is configured by adding a file named `.travis.yml` which is a [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) format text file, to the root directory of the repository. This is the most basic example:

```yml
language: java
jdk: openjdk8
```

Travis environment contains various versions of Open JDK, Oracle JDK, Gradle and Maven. Travis will search for a `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file in order to use Maven or Gradle. Now for linking your GitHub account with Travis account, please follow this steps:

1. Go to [Travis-ci.com](https://travis-ci.com/) and sign up with GitHub.
2. Accept the Authorization of Travis. Youâ€™ll be redirected to GitHub.
3. Click the green Activate button, and select the repositories you want to use with Travis CI

In that way when you push a branch to your repository Travis will execute this steps:

1. Will clone your GitHub repository
2. `gradle assemble`
3. `gradle check`
4. `gradle test`

If previous tasks were successfully executed will generate a build success status:

With Travis CI you can also do this tasks:

1. Run [JaCoCo](https://github.com/jacoco/jacoco) code coverage and fail the build if desired percentage is not met
2. Run [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) code quality checks
3. Built [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image and publish it


**Sonarqube Configuration**

In order to add Sonarqube you need to add this plugin to your `build.gradle` file:

```bash
plugins {
  id "org.sonarqube" version "2.7"
}
```

Next step is to set three environment variables in your Travis project configuration:

* SONAR_LOGIN
* SONAR_PROJECT
* SONAR_URL

Sonar login is an user token, in your Sonarqube account go to `User>My Account>Security` Your existing tokens are listed here, each with a Revoke button. Sonar project is your Project Key defined in the Sonar project main section and sonar url is your Sonar server.

Finally in your `.travis.yml` file you need to add the command required to start Sonarqube scanner process

```yml
language: java
jdk: openjdk8
script:
  - ./gradlew sonarqube
```
