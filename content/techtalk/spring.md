## Spring MVC

In this section I'll go through a complete Spring MVC project starting from the begining, means I'll explain every part of building it. The project is Jmailer, an email delivery service and this is its features:

* Spring MVC
* XML Configuration
* Building with Gradle
* Managing exceptions with AOP
* Managing exceptions with HandlerExceptionResolver
* Logger using JMS and ActiveMQ
* Java Melody to measure performance
* Freemarker to manage email templating
* JSON API
* Oauth2 Authentification
* IP Whitelist using interceptors
* Command validation with hibernate
* Java Mail library
* Bootstrap
