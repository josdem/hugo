Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning vector spaces and linear mappings between such spaces. It includes the study of lines, planes, and subspaces, but is also concerned with properties common to all vector spaces.

**Matrices and Vectors Multiplication**

I would like to start talking about how to multiply together two matrices. We will start with a special case of that, of matrix vector multiplication. Let's consider the following example:

`$A = \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 3 \\
        4 & 0 \\
        2 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}$`
